    <!-- <h3> QUESTION 1 :</h3>
    <h1> illusion </h1>
    <p>An illusion is a distortion of the senses, which can reveal how the mind normally
         organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Although illusions distort the human 
         perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.[1]
          <br>
          <br>
        Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions
         (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on
          visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. 
          For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice 
          is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the
           words.[2]
